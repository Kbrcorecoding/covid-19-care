        <h1>Health Canada approves Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine for children aged 5-11</h1>
        <p>Health Canada has approved the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine for children aged five to 11, the department announced Friday.</p><p>
          This means elementary school children will be able to get vaccinated against COVID-19. Previously, only kids aged 12 and up were eligible.
</p><p>
The vaccine will require two doses of 10 micrograms each for kids aged five to 11 — one-third of the dose for adults. The National Advisory Committee on Immunization (NACI) is recommending the two doses be spaced eight weeks apart.
</p><p>
Canada will begin receiving shipments of the doses for young children on Sunday, Public Services and Procurement Minister Filomena Tassi announced Friday. All of the 2.9 million doses ordered will be received by the end of the week.
</p><p>
This is enough vaccine to provide first doses for all eligible children in the country, she said.
</p><p>
        <h1>Recommondation for children updates</h1>

NACI recommends children should not receive another vaccine, such as a flu shot, 14 days before or after the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine. This is to help medical professionals pinpoint the source of any adverse events, and determine whether they are due to the COVID-19 vaccine or something else, according to Dr. Theresa Tam, chief public health officer of Canada.
</p><p>
Children who have previously had COVID-19 may be offered two doses of vaccine, once their acute symptoms have resolved and they are no longer considered infectious, NACI recommends.
</p><p>
Eleven-year-olds should receive the smaller pediatric dose of vaccine, NACI said. But, if they turn 12 between receiving their first and second dose, the second dose can be the adult formulation. Children will be considered fully vaccinated if they receive two doses of either formulation, or one of each.
      </p><p><h1>New trial Pfizer</h1>
Pfizer submitted its trial data to Health Canada on Oct. 1 for evaluation, and the full submission for approval on Oct. 18.
</p><p>
“This is very good news for adults and children alike,” said Dr. Supriya Sharma, a senior medical advisor with Health Canada, at a press conference Friday. “It provides another tool to protect Canadians, and to the relief of many parents, will help bring back a degree of normality to children’s lives, allowing them to more safely do the things that they have missed during the last 20 months.”</p>

        <h1>COVID-19 Risks and Vaccine Information for Older Adults</h1>
        <h2>Increased Risk of Severe Illness from COVID-19</h2>
        <p>Older adults are more likely to get very sick from COVID-19. Getting very sick means that older adults with COVID-19 might need hospitalization, intensive care, or a ventilator to help them breathe, or they might even die. The risk increases for people in their 50s and increases in 60s, 70s, and 80s. People 85 and older are the most likely to get very sick.</p><p>
Other factors can also make you more likely to get severely ill with COVID-19, such as having certain underlying medical conditions. If you have an underlying medical condition, you should continue to follow your treatment plan, unless advised differently by your health care provider.</p>
        <h2>Protect Yourself & Others from Getting COVID-19</h2>
        <p>Older adults, and those who live with, visit or provide care for them need, to take steps to protect themselves from getting COVID-19.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Get vaccinated as soon as possible. COVID-19 vaccines are effective in preventing COVID-19 and are recommended for everyone 12 years of age and older.</li><li>
If you are fully vaccinated, you can resume activities that you did prior to the pandemic without wearing a mask or staying 6 feet apart, except where required by federal, state, local, tribal, or territorial laws, rules, and regulations, including local business and workplace guidance.</li><li>
If you are not fully vaccinated and aged 2 or older, you should wear a mask in indoor public places.</li><li>
In general, you do not need to wear a mask in outdoor settings.</li><li>
In areas with high numbers of COVID-19 cases, consider wearing a mask in crowded outdoor settings and for activities with close contact with others who are not fully vaccinated.
People who have a condition or are taking medications that weaken their immune system may NOT be protected even if they are fully vaccinated. They should continue to take all precautions recommended for unvaccinated people, including wearing a well-fitted mask, until advised otherwise by their healthcare provider.</li><li>
If you are fully vaccinated, see When You’ve Been Fully Vaccinated.</li><li>
Limit your in-person interactions with other people as much as possible, particularly when indoors.</li><li>
Keep space between yourself and others (stay 6 feet away, which is about 2 arm lengths).</li><li>
Wash your hands often. If soap and water are not readily available, use a hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol.</li><li>
Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands.</li><li>
Cover coughs and sneezes with a tissue or the inside of your elbow. Then wash your hands.</li><li>
Clean and disinfect surfaces and things you touch often.</li><li>
The more people you interact with, the more closely you interact with them, and the longer that interaction, the more likely you are to get or spread the virus that causes COVID-19.
</li><li>
Get vaccinated as soon as possible. COVID-19 vaccines are effective in preventing COVID-19 and are recommended for everyone 12 years of age and older.
          </li>

        <h2>Visiting Older Adults in Residential Communities</h2>
        <p>Residential communities for older adults may combine nursing, assisted living, and independent living lifestyles. Each community may face different risks and decide to put in place less restrictive or more restrictive protocols.</p><p>
To help protect friends and family members who live in these communities, get vaccinated. CDC has also issued updated recommendations for visitations at post-acute facilities. These recommendations align with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS)external iconexternal icon guidance for visitations under various circumstances.</p><p>
